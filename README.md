### Hi there 👋


ARVIN STUDIO/arvin-plugin is a startup company engaged in digital signal processing branch software, especially audio plug-ins for digital audio workstations and located in Indonesia
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 We are working on the first simple audio plugin for DAW with SDK Legacy version 2.4 with ide borland delphi 7
- 🌱 Currently we are learning to use another Juce framework with the Integrated Development Environment Visual Studio 2019 VC++ and constructing several new frameworks for making this audio plugin to make it more up-to-date
- 🤔 we are looking for knowledge about dsp according to needs such as the definition of audio distortion, how the equalizer and fast fourier transform work
- 🙏 we still need the help of experienced experts
